# This APKBUILD builds bare metal executable; options are very specific!
# * there are no tests (how do you even test the bootloader?);
# * binaries are "arch-independent"; aarch64 build also produces armv7 binary,
#   because ARM CPUs boot in 32-bit mode;
# * there are no depends for bootloader, it's a kernel and OS in one binary;
# * stripping of unused sections is done in lk2nd's own ld script.
